# Life Expectancy Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to predict life expectancy using multivariate linear regression, both from scratch and with scikit-learn, on the "Life Expectancy Data.csv" dataset. The notebook includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), model implementation, evaluation, and a discussion of the business value.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Predict the `Life expectancy` of a country based on various health, demographic, and socio-economic features.
- **Approach:** 
  - Implement linear regression from scratch using gradient descent.
  - Compare results with scikit-learnâ€™s `LinearRegression`.
  - Perform EDA to understand the data and feature relationships.
  - Visualize results and compare model performance.

## Key Steps

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Inspect data structure, missing values, and summary statistics.
   - Visualize the distribution of life expectancy.
   - Explore feature correlations.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Drop categorical columns for simplicity.
   - Impute missing values with the mean.
   - Split data into training and test sets.
   - Normalize features.

3. **Modeling:**
   - Implement linear regression from scratch (gradient descent).
   - Train and evaluate both custom and scikit-learn models.
   - Compare model coefficients and prediction performance.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Plot training loss curve for the custom model.
   - Visualize predictions vs. true values for both models.

## Business Value

Accurate life expectancy prediction helps:
- Identify key health and socio-economic drivers.
- Guide resource allocation and policy interventions.
- Monitor and improve population health outcomes.
